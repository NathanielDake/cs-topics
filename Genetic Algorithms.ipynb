    "The comparison with genetics is here really helpful. Indeed, the DNA is composed of genes, and each of those genes comes through different alleles (different versions of this gene). Genetic algorithms retain this concept of population’s DNA.\n",

    "The main idea to keep in mind when we create the first population is that we must not point the population towards a solution that seems good. We must make the population as wide as possible and make it cover as many possibilities as possible. The perfect first population of a genetic algorithm should cover every existing allele.\n",
