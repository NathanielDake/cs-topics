    "# The Traveling Salesperson Problem\n",
    "If you have never encountered the traveling sales person problem, it can be seen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem\">here</a>. It is a classic problem in the field of computer science, and most certainly worth looking. A short and sweet problem description is as follows:\n",
    "> *Given a set of cities and the distance between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once, and returns to the starting city?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough is going to work on developing some solutions to the problem, and in general demonstrate *how to think about* solving problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tsp.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we want to ask whenever faced with a problem of this sort, is do we understand the problem statement enoguh to program a solution? Let's think for a moment:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* ***Given a set of cities***<br>\n",
    "    A Python `set` could represent a set of cities. An individual city may be just an integer index, or it might be (x,y) coordinates.  \n",
    "* ***...and the distance between each pair of cities***<br>\n",
    "    We could use either a function, `distance(A, B)`, or a table, `distance[A,B]`. \n",
    "* ***...what is the shortest possible tour***<br>\n",
    "    A tour is a sequential order in which to visit the cities; a function `shortest_tour(tours)` should find the one that minimizes `tour_length(tour)`, which is the sum of the distances between adjacent cities in the tour. \n",
    "* ***...that visits each city once and returns to the starting city***<br>\n",
    "    Make sure the tour doesn't re-visit a city (except returning to the start)\n",
    "    \n",
    "At this point we don't have all of the answers, but we have are at a good point to start attacking the problem! We can being by bringing in a few imports that we will utilize during the notebook."

    "**Tours**: A tour that starts in city 1, moves to 2, then 3, then back to 1 will be represented by `(1, 2, 3)`. Any valid tour of a set of cities will be a *permutation* of the cities. That means that we can implement `alltours` with the built in `permutations` function (from `itertools` module). Recall, **permutation** is the case where order matters. The length of a tour is the sum of the distances between adjacent cities in the tour - the sum of the lengths of the **links** between cities in the tour. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cities**: The only thing we need to know about a city is its distance to other cities. We don't need to know its name, population, or anything else. We'll assume the distance between two cities is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance\">Euclidean distance</a>, the straight-line distance between points in a two-dimensional plane. So we want `City(300, 100)` to be the city with x-coordinate 300 and y coordinate 100. At first glance it seems like Python does not have a builtin type for a point in the two-dimensional plane, but there actually is one: complex numbers. We can implement `City` with `complex`, which means the distance between two cities, `distance(A, B)` is the absolute value of the vector difference between them. If has been a while since you worked with complex numbers, recall that the absolute value of a complex number is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The absolute value of a complex number is also known as the **modulus**. In case this isn't clear, recall that the definition of the absolute value of a variable, $x$, is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $$|x| = \\sqrt{x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can apply the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number, *it's distance from the origin 0*, to the complex case. Hence, the absolute value of a complex number is defined by the Euclidean distance of the complex point to the origin. The can be computed using pythagorean theorem, but thankfully python has a built in `abs` function we can make use of. Feel free to read more about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value#Complex_numbers\">absolute value of complex numbers</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define `Cities(n)` to make a set of `n` random cities. We want `Cities(n)` to be reproducible (to return the same result when called with the same arugments), so we provide an optional argument that sets `random.seed`. "
