    "In any problem, the most important thing that we must do is understand the specifics of the problem. Do we understand precisely what the problem is asking? Do we understand all the concepts that the problem talks about?  Do we understand them well enough to implement them in a programming language? Let's take a first pass:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A set of cities**: We will need to represent a set of cities; Python's `set` datatype might be appropriate.\n",
    "- **Distance between each pair of cities**: If `A` and `B` are cities, this could be a function, `distance(A, B),` or a table lookup, `distance[A][B]`.  The resulting distance will be a real number.\n",
    "- **City**: All we have to know about an individual city is how far it is from other cities. We don't have to know its name, population, best restaurants, or anything else. So a city could be just an integer (0, 1, 2, ...) used as an index into a distance table, or a city could be a pair of (x, y) coordinates, if we are using straight-line distance on a plane.\n",
    "- **Tour**: A tour is a specified order in which to visit the cities; Python's `list` or `tuple` datatypes would work. For example, given the set of cities `{A, B, C, D}`, a tour might be the list `[B, D, A, C]`, which means to travel from `B` to `D` to `A` to `C` and finally back to `B`.\n",
    "- **Shortest possible tour**: The shortest tour is the one whose tour length is the minimum of all tours.\n",
    "- **Tour length**: The sum of the distances between adjacent cities in the tour (including the last city back to the first city).   Probably  a function, `tour_length(tour)`.\n",
    "- **What is ...**: We can define a function to answer the question *what is the shortest possible tour?*  The function takes a set of cities as input and returns a tour as output. I will use the convention that any such function will have a name ending in the letters \"`tsp`\", the traditional abbreviation for Traveling Salesperson Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage I have a rough sketch of how to attack the problem.  I don't have all the answers, and I haven't committed to specific representations for all the concepts, but I know what all the pieces are, and I don't see anything that stops me from proceeding."

    "We determined that the only thing that matters about cities is the distance between them. But before we can decide about how to represent cities, and before we can define `distance(A, B)`,  we have to make a choice. In the fully general version of the TSP, the \"distance\" between two cities could be anything: it could factor in the amount of time it takes to travel between cities, the twistiness of the road, or anything else. The `distance(A, B)` might be different from `distance(B, A)`. So the distances could be represented by a matrix `distance[A][B]`, where any entry in the matrix could be any (non-negative) numeric value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "But we will ignore the fully general TSP and concentrate on an important special case, the **Euclidean TSP**, where the distance between any two cities is the [Euclidean distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance), the straight-line distance between points in a two-dimensional plane. So a city can be represented by a two-dimensional point: a pair of *x* and *y* coordinates. We will use the constructor function `City`, so that `City(300, 0)` creates a city with x-coordinate of 300 and y coordinate of 0.  Then `distance(A, B)` will be a function that uses the *x* and *y* coordinates to compute the distance between `A` and `B`.\n",

    "* **complex:** Python already has the two-dimensional point as a built-in numeric data type, but in a non-obvious way: as `complex` numbers, which inhabit the two-dimensional (real &times; imaginary) plane.  **Pro:** efficient. **Con:** a little confusing; doesn't distinguish Points from other complex numbers.\n",

    "1. IPython's matplotlib plots (by default) in a rectangle that is 1.5 times wider than it is high; that's why I specified a width of 900 and a height of 600. If you want the coordinates of your cities to be bounded by a different size rectangle, you can change width or height.\n",

    "2. Sometimes I want `Cities(n)` to be a true function, returning the same result each time. This is very helpful for getting repeatable results: if I run a test twice, I get the same results twice. \n",
    "But other times I would like to be able to do an experiment, where, for example, I call `Cities(n)` 30 times and get 30 different sets, and I then compute the average tour length produced by my algorithm across these 30 sets. Can I get both behaviors out of one function? *Yes!*  The trick is the additional optional parameter, `seed`.  Two calls to `Cities` with the same `n` and `seed` parameters will always return the same set of cities, and two calls with different values for `seed` will return different sets. This is implemented by calling the function `random.seed`, which resets the random number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once I create a set of Cities, I don't want anyone messing with my set. For example, I don't want an algorithm that claims to \"solve\" a problem by deleting half the cities from the input set, then finding a tour of the remaining cities.  Therefore, I make `Cities` return a `frozenset` rather than a `set`.  A `frozenset` is *immutable*; nobody can change it once it is created. (Likewise, each city is immutable.)\n",

    "At the start of the *Approximate Algorithms* section, we mentioned two ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:** Make the tour go from a city to its nearest neighbor. Repeat.\n",
    "2. **Greedy Algorithm:** Find the shortest distance between any two cities and include that in the tour. Repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time to develop the *greedy algorithm*, so-called because at every step it greedily adds to the tour the edge that is shortest (even if that is not best in terms of long-range planning).  The nearest neighbor algorithm always extended the tour by adding on to the end.  The greedy algorithm is different in that it doesn't have a notion of *end* of the tour; instead it keeps a *set* of partial segments. Here's a brief statement of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Greedy Algorithm:** *Maintain a set of segments; intially each city defines its own 1-city segment. Find the shortest possible edge that connects two endpoints of two different segments, and join those segments with that edge. Repeat until we form a segment that tours all the cities.*\n",
    "\n",
    "On each step of the algorithm, we want to \"find the shortest possible edge that connects two endpoints.\" That seems like an expensive operation to do on each step. So we will add in some data structures to enable us to speed up the computation.  Here's a more detailed sketch of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-compute a list of **edges**, sorted by shortest edge first. An edge is a pair of cities; if the list contains `(A, B)` then it does not contain `(B, A)`, and it never contains `(A, A)`.\n",
    "2. Maintain a dict that maps **endpoints** to **segments**, e.g. `{A: [A, B, C, D], D: [A, B, C, D]}`. Initially, each city is the endpoint of its own 1-city-long segment, but as we join segments together, some cities are no longer endpoints and are removed from the dict.\n",
    "3. Go through the edges in shortest-first order. When you find an edge `(A, B)` such that both `A` and `B` are endpoints of different segments, then join the two segments together.  Maintain the endpoints dict to reflect this new segment. Stop when you create\n",
    "a segment that contains all the cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example: assume we have seven cities,  labeled A through G.  Suppose CG happens to be the shortest edge.  We would add the edge to the partial tour, by joining the segment that contains C with the segment that contains G.  In this case, the joining is easy, because each segment is one city long; we join them to form a segment two cities long. We then look at the next shortest edge and continue the process, joining segments as we go, as shown in the table below. Some edges cannot be used.  For example, FD cannot be used, because by the time it becomes the shortest edge, D is already in the interior of a segment. Next, AE cannot be used, even though both A and E are endpoints, because it would make a loop out of ACGDE.  Finally, note that sometimes we may have to reverse a segment.  For example, EF can merge AGCDE and BF, but first we have to reverse BF to FB. \n",

Then I add the B segment on to the end of the A segment. Finally, I update the `endpoints` dict. This is a bit tricky!  My first thought was that A and B are no longer endpoints, because they have been joined together in the interior of the segment.  However, that isn't always true.  If A was the endpoint of a 1-city segment, then when you join it to B, A is still an endpoint.  I could have had complicated logic to handle the case when A, B, or both, or neither were 1-city segments, but I decided on a different tactic: first unconditionally delete A and B from the endpoints dict, no matter what.  Then add the two endpoints of the new segment (which is `Asegment`) to the endpoints dict.  "

    "That's all I'm going to write for now.  But there are still plenty of open questions for you to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Branch and Cut**: this is a technique to cut off a search early, when a partial solution is obviously not optimal.  We saw how Held-Karp cuts off some permutations of cities when another permutation is better.  A refinement on that is to keep track of, say, the best total length of the segment going through all the Bs cities.  Then, any time you have a partial segment through some of the Bs cities that exceeds the best total, we can stop right there, before even finishing all the Bs.  With this technique, you can find optimal tours for around 50 cities.\n",
    "* **Linear programming**: Lookup the topic \"linear programming\" and see how it applies to TSP.\n",
    "* **Heuristic Algorithms**: There are many approaches for using heurisitic estimates to find good (but not optimal) tours.  For example, *ant colony optimization algorithms* make random choices of which edge to follow, and then the edges that occur in the best tours get reinforced with some virtual pheromones, and other ants tend to follow those pheromones. *Simulated annealing* takes its inspiration from metallurgy.\n",
    "* The **[Lin-Kernighan heuristic](http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/LKH-1.3/DOC/LKH_REPORT.pdf)**  is one of the best.\n",
    "* The **[Christofides algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm)** gives a guarantee of 3/2 the optimal tour length (improving on the minimum-spanning-tree guarantee).\n",
    "* `altered` as a function: we defined a lot of one-line functions that just called another algorithm, and then calls `alter_tour` on the result.  Can you write a function, `altered(func)`, which takes a TSP algorithm as argument, and returns a TSP algorithm that does the original algorithm and then calls `alter_tour`?\n",
    "* Why does `mst` produce an optimal result, while `greedy_tsp` does not, even though the two algorithms have similar structure in the way they iterate over `shortest_edges_first`?\n",
    "* The code in this notebook was designed for clarity, not efficiency.  Can you make the code faster?\n",
    "* [William Cook](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/) maintains a great page on the TSP.\n",
    "* William Cook also has a [draft chapter](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/papers/comp_chapter1.pdf) on Discrete Optimization featuring TSP. His algorithms are in C, and he chooses a different set of algorithms to explore. I find his explanation very beautiful and concise.\n",
    "* If you are heavily into math, there's a [taxonomy](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/9241/approximation-algorithms-for-metric-tsp) of solutions.\n",
    "* What else are you interested in?"
